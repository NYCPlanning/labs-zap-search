          <p>ZAP Search's underlying database, ZAP, does not include geometries. Projects in ZAP only contain addresses and BBLs. ZAP Search appends geometries to each project by joining BBLs with data from the latest version of <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page#pluto"><strong>MapPLUTO</strong>&nbsp;{{fa-icon icon='external-link-alt'}}</a>. Center points are created by taking a centroid of lot geometries returned by MapPLUTO.</p>
